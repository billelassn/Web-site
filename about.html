            <p>Hello! My name is Billel Aissani.</p>
            <h1>From a strong background in finance and data analysis to a passion for AI in healthcare.</h1>
            <p>
                As a graduate engineer from <span class="highlight-blue">Mines Saint-Étienne</span> and <span class="highlight-blue">Université Paris Dauphine - PSL</span>, I've developed solid expertise in data analysis, statistical modeling, and optimization. I've successfully applied these skills as a <span class="highlight-blue">Pricing and Data Analyst</span> in financial and insurance sectors, specializing in risk modeling and data transformation.
            </p>
            <p>
                My professional experience awakened a desire to give a more human meaning to my skills. This led me to a passionate career pivot towards Artificial Intelligence, particularly in the <span class="highlight-blue">healthcare sector</span>. I've strengthened my expertise through an <span class="highlight-blue">AI in Health Certificate at CNAM Paris</span> and my current enrollment in the <span class="highlight-blue">ST4H (Sciences & Technology for Health) Master's</span> program at Université PSL.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am deeply passionate about leveraging <span class="highlight-blue">AI to accelerate scientific discoveries</span>, from <span class="highlight-blue">cheminformatics</span> and <span class="highlight-blue">drug design</span> to diagnostics. I've applied these interests in real-world challenges like the <span class="highlight-blue">Owkin challenge</span> for PIK3CA mutation detection and my current role as a Data Scientist at <span class="highlight-blue">Nepita</span>, where I'm working with cutting-edge <span class="highlight-blue">volatomics</span> technology for disease diagnosis.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am actively seeking to connect with professionals who are passionate about using AI to revolutionize healthcare and solve urgent global challenges.
