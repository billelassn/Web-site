            <p>Hello! My name is Billel Aissani.</p>
            <h1>From a strong background in finance and data analysis to a passion for AI in healthcare.</h1>
            <p>
                As a graduate engineer from **Mines Saint-Étienne** and **Université Paris Dauphine - PSL**, I've developed solid expertise in data analysis, statistical modeling, and optimization. I've successfully applied these skills as a **Pricing and Data Analyst** in financial and insurance sectors, specializing in risk modeling and data transformation.
            </p>
            <p>
                My professional experience awakened a desire to give a more human meaning to my skills. This led me to a passionate career pivot towards Artificial Intelligence, particularly in the **healthcare sector**. I've strengthened my expertise through an **AI in Health Certificate at CNAM Paris** and my current enrollment in the **ST4H (Sciences & Technology for Health) Master's** program at Université PSL.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am deeply passionate about leveraging **AI to accelerate scientific discoveries**, from **cheminformatics** and **drug design** to diagnostics. I've applied these interests in real-world challenges like the **Owkin challenge** for PIK3CA mutation detection and my current role as a Data Scientist at **Nepita**, where I'm working with cutting-edge **volatomics** technology for disease diagnosis.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am actively seeking to connect with professionals who are passionate about using AI to revolutionize healthcare and solve urgent global challenges.
            </p>
